# this IDL is not used by the globus build process.  it is a developer
# tool to drive automatic regeneration of the object and error type hierarchy
# code and/or documentation from one concise definition.  it is part of a very 
# special-purpose hack.
#
# please do not change these files unless you really know what you are doing!
#
#

# IDL format
# type:parenttype{instance fields}stringfunc:indication
#
# types are shorthand (just the unique part of the GLOBUS_ERROR_TYPE_* name)
# list local instance fields only (not inherited)
# instance fields default to globus_object_t * type if none given
# instance fields separated by comma
# indication is english comment for web doc
#
# entries must be in order, supertype before subtype
#
# BASE is handled specially and has no parent type in the IDL
